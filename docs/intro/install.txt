Quick install guide
===================

Before you can use Transifex, you'll need to get it installed. This guide 
will guide you to a simple, minimal installation that'll work while you 
walk through the introduction.

Installing Python
-----------------

Being a Python Web tool, Transifex requires Python. We recommend 
installing Python 2.5 or later.

Get Python at http://www.python.org. If you're running Linux or Mac OS X, 
you probably already have it installed.

You can verify that Python's installed by typing ``python`` from your 
shell; you should see something like::

  Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Jun 15 2008, 18:24:51)
  [GCC 4.3.0 20080428 (Red Hat 4.3.0-8)] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

Installing the Version Control Systems - VCS
--------------------------------------------

To run Transifex you need some VCS. Depending of which ones you want 
to use, you will need to install some of the following packages:

* Bazaar (bzr)
* CVS (cvs)
* Git (git)
* Mercurial (hg)
* Subversion (svn)

On Fedora you can run the following command to install all those VCS:

  .. code-block:: bash

   yum install cvs subversion mercurial git bzr bzrtools

Some extra Python packages needed
---------------------------------

For provide some features as markdown and to cover some other 
:ref:`django applications dependencies<install-django-app>`, you need 
to install:

  * Markdown
  * Python-openid
  * Httplib2

You can install by using ``easy_install``:

  .. code-block:: bash

   easy_install markdown python-openid httplib2


or on Fedora you can run:

  .. code-block:: bash

   yum install python-markdown python-openid python-httplib2

Installing Django
-----------------

Transifex is developed on top a Python Web Framework called Django. We 
recommend installing Django 1.0. You can get more information about how
to install Django in your system referring http://docs.djangoproject.com.

On Fedora you can just run:

  .. code-block:: bash

   yum install Django

.. _install-django-app:

Installing Django applications depedencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django supports to use different applications inside a Django project. 
Transifex does use some of this available applications to provide some 
specific features as OpenID support, notifications, pagination, tagging,
contact-form, etc.

All those application denpendencies can be downloaded from 
http://code.google.com/p/<application_name> and then installed by using 
the setup.py or creating a symbolic link as following:

  * django-tagging_ (python setup.py install)
  * django_authopenid_ (python setup.py install)
  * django-pagination_ (create a symbolic link in your PYTHONPATH)
  * django-contact-form_ (python setup.py install)

.. _django-tagging: http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging
.. _django_authopenid: http://code.google.com/p/django_authopenid
.. _django-pagination: http://code.google.com/p/django-pagination
.. _django-contact-form: http://code.google.com/p/django-contact-form

For notifications (it's optional):

  * django-notification_ (create a symbolic link in your PYTHONPATH)
  * http://django-atompub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/atompub/atom.py
    (download it and rename to ``atomformat.py`` and put it somewhere in 
    your PYTHONPATH)

.. _django-notification: http://code.google.com/p/django-notification

Installing Transifex
--------------------

After you have all dependencies and packages installed, the Transifex 
installation should be very simple. You only need to customize the 
``settings.py``, ``urls.py``, and then run:

  .. code-block:: bash

   ./manage.py syncdb
   ./manage.py runserver 8088

  .. warning::
 
    Make sure you have created in your system all the directories 
    configured in your ``settings.py`` file, like the GIT_REPO_PATH and
    HG_REPO_PATH, if you have enabled ``git`` and ``hg`` in VCS_CHOICES,
    for example. Without those paths created the checkout for these VCS
    will fail.

To enable debugging, run the server as follows:

  .. code-block:: bash

   ./manage.py runserver --settings settings_debug

Initializing some data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transifex uses the fixtures feature of Django to load some initial datas
in the database.

  .. note::
 
    Make sure you have executed the ``./manage.py syncdb``
    command before run the following commands.

  .. code-block:: bash

   ./manage.py loaddata vcs/fixtures/sample_data.json
   ./manage.py loaddata projects/fixtures/sample_data.json
   ./manage.py loaddata translations/fixtures/sample_data.json

Testing
-------

For testing the whole project you can run:

  .. code-block:: bash

   ./manage.py test

For testing a specific application inside Transifex you can run:

  .. code-block:: bash

   ./manage.py test projects
