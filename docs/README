To build the docs, you will need to have a working Transifex
system (dependencies there, 'python manage.py shell' working).
If you're using a virtualenv, make sure you enable it.

To build/publish the docs, I usually do something like:

workon current
make clean && make html
firefox html/index.html

# Publish:
cd html
scpresume * txo:webapps/txo_docs/

To get translators:

hg log -r 0.7:tip --template "{desc|firstline} -- {author|person}\n" | \
grep 'l10n' | sort | uniq

To get the new deps:

hg diff -r 0.7:tip setup.py
