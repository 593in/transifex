What's new in Transifex 0.7
---------------------------

The following major features were introduced in this release.

Online Translation Editor
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

One of the often requested features in Transifex was an online translation
editor. Users would like to perform simple translation tasks straight from
their browser.

Transifex 0.7 includes an exciting feature in beta mode: 'Lotte', the
lightweight online translation editor.

Projects which have enabled translation submission get a new icon, which
translators can click to translate through the browser. Of course, the choice
of uploading normal translated files still applies.

Note that currently Lotte is enabled only for files with less than 100 strings.
Improvements to the interface to enable efficient handling of larger files are
scheduled with a next release.

More control to Project Maintainers
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

.. image:: ../_screenshots/0.7/0.7_edit-project.png
   :class: shot2

This release features a major addition to the Transifex engine, which unlocks
a multitude of new possibilities for controlling who can do what on the
service. Support is now included for fine-grained permission control, allowing
the definition of access control lists for a variety of actions.

These fine-grained permissions come *in addition* to the global permission
support Transifex includes. One user of your deployment can have the permission
"Can do Foo on any project", and another one the "Can do Foo on project Bar"
one.

Project details control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Project maintainers are now able to modify the details of their projects. They
can alter the associated information, control the components they have
registered and the releases they are assigned to.

Registering projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../_screenshots/0.7/0.7_acl.png
   :class: shot2

Transifex now allows users to register their own projects. People who do this
automatically become maintainers of the project, and later on they can choose
to pass on the maintainership to other people, or simply add more people on
the maintainers list.

To enable this feature, the admin needs to give the permission
'projects.add_project' to the group of users with the name 'registered'.
This can be done as usual from the admin panel.

Per-project submitters list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Project maintainers are now able to choose who can submit files to their
repository. This can help the maintainer form a group of translators who he
trusts, which is specific to his project. Using a special form, one can add
one by one the translators they trust.

Additionally, users themselves can request access to a project. The maintainer
will be notified with this request and act upon it. The user has the choice to
revoke his request, if he chooses so.

Submissions via email
:::::::::::::::::::::

In addition to submitting files to remote versioning systems over SSH,
Transifex now supports submission via email to the project maintainers. This
could be useful for setup scenarios such as the following:

1. The content repository is living behind a firewall and/or NAT, making
   external connections harder to configure and manage.

2. The upstream repository does not allow SSH access (eg. it only supports
   ``https``).

3. The repository pulls from a tarball hosted on the net (eg. it's an archived
   release), to which Transifex has no way to submit files.  

4. The maintainer chooses to have a tighter control of what is landing in his
   repository.

.. image:: ../_screenshots/0.7/0.7_submit-via-email.png
   :class: shot2 alcenter

.. note::

    Submissions via email are **not** stored on the Transifex server. The
    translation statistics are not updated with the commit, since there is no
    way to know if the maintainer is indeed going to commit the file in his
    repository.

User Profiles
:::::::::::::

.. image:: ../_screenshots/0.7/0.7_avatar.png
   :class: shot2

Transifex 0.7 features a brand new backend for user account and profile
management. Users are able to include information about themselves and manage
their account in detail. Here are some of the features supported:

- Avatar support
- Google Maps Integration for specifying the user's exact location
- Standard account features: Register for a new account, login/logout
- Password management (change password, recover lost one, etc.)
- Email address modification 
- Ability to clear profile information

.. warning::

    OpenID was dropped in this release. The plan is to re-add it in a next
    release, depending on the feedback from our users. 

Publican-like I18n Support
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

.. image:: ../_screenshots/0.7/0.7_publican.png
   :class: shot2

This new i18n support method allows handling of Publican-like documents. These
include multiple source and translation files, allowing more than one people
translating the same language by working on different files at the same time.
Publican is the base tool for building the Fedora Project documents such as
the Release Notes.


Other new features
------------------

User sign in changes
::::::::::::::::::::

- By default users are kept logged in for 3 weeks. This is an option which can
  be configured by the administrator from the setting files.
- Upon account creation, users are now automatically added to a group called
  'registered'. This way, admins can add permissions to all eponymous users,
  distinguishing them from the anonymous ones.
- Replaced 'Log in' template occurrences to 'Sign in'.

I18n support improvements
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

.. image:: ../_screenshots/0.7/0.7_zebra.png
   :class: shot2

- A new command was added, ``./manage.py txcompilemessages``, which replaces
  Django's own ``compilemessages``, since the latter recursively builds all PO
  files for many more things than the ones we need. This affects admins who are
  building their own Transifex PO files.
- 0.7 adds built-in support for the following new languages:

  - Asturian (ast)
  - Esperanto (eo)
  - Irish (ga)
  - Kashmiri (ks)
  - Kirgyz (ky)
  - Latin (la)
  - Xhosa (xh)

- Added support for a whooping set of language code aliases (#267).
- Added number of languages and projects to the index view
- Added toggle to expand and collapse the multi source files div (#220).
- Commit messages are now by default prepended with the keyword 'l10n' prefix
  (#209). This option is configurable through the setting files.
- Commit messages now have the user's profile info embedded instead of just
  the username (#235).

- Speed improvements across the platform
- Divided Component form in tabs and fixed the validation issues
- Added tooltip for submission note
- Made base template inheritable for easier overriding.

Upgrading to 0.7
----------------

To upgrade the code, update your package distribution as usual.

Dependencies
::::::::::::

The following dependencies were *added* in this version:

- Imaging (Python Imaging Library, PIL)
- polib
- django-authority
- South
- django-piston
- django-profile (named 'userprofile')

The following dependencies were *removed* in this version:

- python-openid
- django-evolution

For instructions on how to install them, refer to the
:ref:`Installation docs <intro-install>`. You'll need to complete this step
before actually doing the database upgrade.

Database migration
::::::::::::::::::

Transifex includes a script which will automatically migrate your database to
the new schema from the previous version. All you need to do, from a clean
0.6 schema, is run the following::

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py migrate 0001_initial --all --fake
    ./manage.py migrate

.. note::

    Transifex does not support direct database migration from 0.5 to 0.7. To
    upgrade from a 0.5 schema it's necessary to first upgrade your schema to
    v0.6. Instructions to do this can be found in relevant section of the
    :ref:`Transifex 0.6 release notes <upgrading-to-0-6>`.


Getting Transifex 0.7
---------------------

Project and community managers who want to deploy Transifex for their 
own community can get Transifex in a variety of ways. 

A tarball of Transifex 0.7 is available at http://transifex.org/files/.

RPM packages for Fedora 9, Fedora 10, and Fedora Rawhide are or will 
soon be available via yum::

    yum install transifex transifex-extras 

RPM packages for RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and Scientific Linux 5 will be 
available in `Fedora EPEL`_. 


The Transifex Appliance
:::::::::::::::::::::::

If you want to play with the latest Transifex code, you may want to use our
development images for the Transifex Appliance. Following the stand-alone,
"batteries included" model of software appliances, you get a complete
Transifex system with all dependencies and services pre-configured so that
you can start experimenting with it right away. Choose from ISO, VMware or EC2
images, for both x86 and x86_64 architectures to run on a virtual machine,
dedicated server or using a virtualization software.

Your appliances can be updated using its own web based management system by
pointing your browser to the appliance’s IP using port 8003. Login with the
credentials 'admin' and 'password'. Make sure to change the password once
you’ve successfully logged in.

This appliance version is based on the 0.7 branch of Transifex, where a couple
of projects have already been created for you to play with. Log in using either
guest/guest or editor/editor as your user name and password combination and
tinker to your heart’s content!

Make sure to read the documentation and file issues/send us your feedback.
