Summary
-------

Welcome to the Transifex 0.6 release, codenamed Magneto_.

This release marks a major release in the advancement of Transifex, and includes
a number of new exciting new features and many, many bugfixes. It is currently
scheduled to be released in late April 2009 and is targeted for new
installations of Transifex and parties who choose to migrate to a new major
version and enjoy the new features.

Transifex 0.6 is intended for production use.


What's new in Transifex 0.6
---------------------------

The following major features were introduced in this release.

File monitoring
:::::::::::::::

Repowatch documentation.

- Multiple users
- Email notifications
- How to use, enable, etc.


Internationalization support
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Transifex 0.5 has included support for translation of its interface in various
languages. This release makes this support available in the interface itself.
Users can choose the language of their choice from a drop-down menu of available
languages on the top-right part of the screen.

Following the policy 'eat our own dogfood', Transifex is in fact translatable
through Transifex itself. Volunteer contributions for new translations and
improvements in the existing translations are submitted through Transifex at
http://www.transifex.net/.


Translation file archives
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

Transifex now adds support for downloading compressed archives containing the
files belonging to a release for a particular language. The compressed archive
types supported are **zip files** and gzipped **tarballs**.

Translators can now retrieve a compressed file containing all the files needed
to translate the release's components to their language. An example URL
providing this feature is ``/languages/fr/collection/gnome/2.26/download_zip/``.

This feature eliminates the need to download one file at a time, and is
especially useful for very active contributors and people with slow Internet
connectivity.


User Interface improvements
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

During the development cycle of 0.6, quite a few improvements in the user
interface took place here and there. Here's a list of the most important ones:

Untranslated components list
  The language-release page now include a list of components which haven't
  had any translations so far. This gives a better picture of the parts which
  need translation to make the completion status increase.

More RSS feeds
  The release page with the completion percentage of each language is now
  published also as an RSS feed, allowing people like release engineer to easily
  check the translation status of their release.

Easy file selection for editing
  The 'advanced' submission form now supports either editing a remote file or
  creating a new one. The user can choose either to overwrite an existing
  file or create a new one.

Sortable statistics tables
  The tables presented are now sortable by a number of variables, including
  the language name and the completion percentage, depending on how the user
  prefers to view the list and find the information needed.


Under the hood changes
::::::::::::::::::::::

This release introduces some improvements in the platform itself, which might
interest people who administrate their own Transifex instance or build on top
of the platform.

Revamped settings mechanism
  Settings are now organized in multiple files under the ``settings/``
  directory, allowing easier management and override. (r456)

Improved abstraction for repositories
  Codebases, VCS, etc. (r461)
