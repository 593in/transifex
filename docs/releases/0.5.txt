===================================

Welcome to the Transifex 0.5 release.

This represents a significant advance in Transifex development since the 0.4
release in July 2008. The one most major change is the complete re-write of
the code from scratch, migrating to the Django framework.

Following is a summarized list of the major new features:

* Complete re-write of source code on top of the Django framework
* Refactoring of the version control system level, supporting
  cvs, svn, hg, git and bzr.
* Translation statistics support
* User registrations
* OpenID authentication
* Search support in projects
* Support for notification on changes in registered projects
* Documentation using the Sphinx library
