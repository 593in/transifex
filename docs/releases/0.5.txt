 Transifex version 0.5 release notes
=====================================

Welcome to the Transifex 0.5 release.

This release represents a significant advance in Transifex development since
the Transifex 0.4 release in November 2008, maybe even the creation of Transifex
itself in 2007. The single most major change is the complete re-write of the
code from scratch, migrating to the Django framework, but also the multitude
of features added, both of which signify a turning point in Transifex's history.

Development for Transifex 0.5 is quite flux right now and the following might
receive minor changes. Even so, they should be considered as a good picture of
our plans for version 0.5.


Summary
=======

Following is a summarized list of the major new features:

- Complete re-write of source code on top of the Django framework
- New data model supporting multiple repositories per project
- Support for highly customizable deployment, including overriding of VCS
  backends, themes and custom classes for I18n support in projects
- Refactoring of the version control system level, supporting
  cvs, svn, hg, git and bzr, hosted anywhere on the Internet.
- Support for calculation of a project's translation coverage (statistics)
- Support for serving translation files to users for easy access to them 
- User registrations
- OpenID authentication
- User permissions support, allowing fine-grained permission handling
- Support for searching for a project
- Support for notification on changes in registered projects
- Documentation using the Sphinx library
- RSS feeds for every element in the system.


Roadmap
=======

Releasing Transifex 0.5 will require quite some planning, coordination and
code. The canonical place where we track the roadmap for the release is
the ticket system at http://transifex.org/milestone/0.5.

To reach Transifex 0.5 Gold, we'll split the work in milestones,
represented as *v0.5m1*. Here's a draft plan for the features in these
milestones.
