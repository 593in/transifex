Transifex version 0.4 release notes
===================================

Transifex 0.4 is a stable release, planned to be published in the start of
November 2008. It is scheduled to be be the last major stable release from the
TurboGears branch.

Transifex 0.4 is planned to be maintained until March 2009, by releasing minor
versions (0.4.x) with bugfixes. This depends on the feedback from the Tx users
themselves. No new features will be added in this branch, however.

Our attention now is on coding Transifex 0.5 from the `tx-django` branch, which
will be the first release based on the Django branch.
