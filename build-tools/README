This is a simple RPM build infrastructure for Transifex. It currently builds 
two packages: 
- transifex: this includes the core transifex software and brings in django 
and mercurial as a dependency
- transifex-extras: this is essentially a meta-package that brings git, cvs, 
svn and pysvn as a dependency. In the future it may also bring in p4python and
polib

Usage: 
	$ ./build.sh <version>

Caveats:
	Must be run from the same directory build.sh is present

Requirements:
	rpmbuild must be present in your system

Output: 
	1 RPMs and 1 SRPMs for each package built (4 total)

Future work: 
- create a package for transifex-docs
- create a package for transifex-modules (django_auth_openid etc.) that will 
contain python modules required for transifex to run
